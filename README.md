##Biocomputing Circuit Optomisation program (Dissertation Project) – Python, Quine McCluskey Algorithm
An example of how I have been able to use Python to manipulate data.

•	Created a Python program that takes a truth table and using Boolean algebraic principles and Majority logic, returns a minimised Majority Logic function that represents a biocomputing circuit
•	The Idea is to automate a complex series of mathematical Logic transformations that would be required to achieve the best final circuit. This process would be extremely time consuming in real life as the best order is not obvious, this code aims to solve this issue.
•	Simulates The best possible order of functions that can be applied to acheieve the best result (mimimum length logic string) using the simulated annealing algorithm.
•	Served as an optomisation and circuit planning tool that to be used in real life PHD Biocomputing research. Optomisation principles, simulated annealing algorithm, Boolean algebraic logic, Quine McCluskey Algorithm and Majority Logic were all programmatically used to make this mathematical tool within Python
