## Biocomputing Circuit Optomisation program – Python, Data manipulation, omtimisation principles, simulated-annealing algorithm, Quine McCluskey Algorithm

An example of how I have been able to use Python to manipulate data.

This project was scored a Distinction.

•	Created a Python program that takes the result of a truth table and using Boolean algebraic principles and Majority logic, returns a minimised Majority Logic function that represents a biocomputing circuit

•	The Idea is to automate a complex series of mathematical Logic transformations that would be required to achieve the best final circuit. This process would be extremely time consuming in real life as the best order is not obvious, this code aims to solve this issue using a series of transforamtions which are applied in different orders and amounts using the simulated annealing algorithm.

•	Simulates The best possible order of functions that can be applied to acheieve the best result (mimimum length logic string) using the simulated annealing algorithm optimising the resulting circuit.

•	Served as an optomisation and circuit planning tool to be used in real life PHD Biocomputing research. Optomisation principles, simulated annealing algorithm, Boolean algebraic logic, Quine McCluskey Algorithm and Majority Logic were all programmatically used to make this mathematical tool within Python.
